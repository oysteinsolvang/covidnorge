9. Description of dataset: 
The dataset is a cross-sectional dataset covering social and public health data pertaining to the Covid-19 outbreak in all 356 Norwegian municipalities. The dataset was compiled from public register data and media sources. Data on Covid-19 cases and related fatalities is current as of ultimo July 2020. Data on other variables is from 2018, 2019 or 2020, depending on data availability. The dataset is based on the revised municipal and county structure, as per January 1st, 2020. Standardized unique unit identifiers (kommunenummer) are included, enabling merging with other data. The dataset was assembled concurrently with a similar one on the country level, as part of  the project «Ressurs for studentaktiv læring i undervisning i statistisk og romlig analyse for samfunnsfag» at the Department of Social Sciences and the Norwegian College for Fishery Science, UiT.

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
---------------------------
1. Description of sources and methods used for collection/generation of data: 

Data was collected through APIs and tables (e.g. CSV-files) downloaded from the webpages of the providers of the various data called for. Data on the variable 'karantene' was acquired by scrutinizing a number of news articles and government publications, and then hand coded to a CSV-file. Data on the variable 'STN' was hand coded to a CSV-file based on a table provided by a public source. For a list of sources, see metadata field Data Sources and file codvidnorge-kodebok.pdf.

2. Methods for processing the data: 
The data was organized, scrutinized and compiled to a single CSV-file by an R-script. Except for the variables 'nordnorge', 'tilfeller1000', 'over1', 'over69' and 'andelover69', values in the dataset are the exact values provided by the sources. For the mentioned variables, some applicable mathematical or logical operation was applied to data on other variables in order to produce the values. For details, see 01_covidnorge-kodebok.pdf and 03_covidnorge-script.R.

The R script imports data -- either through APIs or from locally stored CSV-files (otherwise unaltered after download) -- and performs various operations on the data. This is primarily changing variable names, removing excess variables, and altering data set and variable structure. The script sequentially adds all variables to the object 'data', which is lastly exported as a CSV-file. The last part of the script creates LaTeX-formatted tables of summary statistics on all variables except ID-variables for use in the codebook. 

3. Facility-, instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
The CSV-file is UTF-8 encoded. The R-code uses the 'tidyverse', 'stargazer', 'stringi', 'PxWebApiData', and 'readxl' packages. It is written for R version 4.0.0.
